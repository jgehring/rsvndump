== Schedule for 0.6 ==
> Add log-window-size option (part of github pull request #1)

== Schedule for 0.x ==
> Add --no-stop-on-copy option
> Direct dumping of deltas, thus elmiminating base revision fetching for
  incremental dumps in delta mode
> Include svnbridge patches
> Don't dump properties on copy operations if they didn't change
> Check if revision range determnination can be done faster
> Property storage could be optimized (no add and remove everytime a node is accessed)
> Specify MD5 for copy source on copying
> Optimize delta dumps (i.e., don't apply delta -> generate delta ->
    read delta).
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1). This is problematic
  with replace-actions, but needs further evaluation
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed
> Check base MD5 in de_apply_textdelta for non-delta dumps

== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> Retries if connection is lost
> Make the '-r'-specifier more like svnadmin (maybe)
> Fix compilation without NLS (if gettext is not present)
> Move MD5-sums for files to the versioned path_hash
> Implement dumping of single files?
