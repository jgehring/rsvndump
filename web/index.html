        <a name="about"><h3>About</h3></a>
        <p>rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a
        Subversion repository that resides on a remote server.
        All data is dumped in the format that can be read an written by
        <i>svnadmin load/dump</i>, so the data which is produced
        can easily be imported into a new Subversion repository.</p>

        <p>rsvndump supports most of the functionality of the normal
        <i>svn</i> client program and <i>svnadmin</i>, e.g. authentication,
        SSL-support, incremental dumps and support for dumping text
        deltas instead of full text.</p>

        <p>Starting with Subversion 1.7 in October 2011, the official distribution already
        contains a <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.7.html#svnrdump">remote dumpfile tool</a>
        called <i>svnrdump</i>.  While both tools serve the same purpose,
        rsvndump is also able to dump a subdirectory of a repository by
        resolving copy operation as needed, even without read access to
        the repository root. Furthermore, rsvndump may work better with
        old Subversion servers (i.e. versions prior to 1.5).

        <p>Further information about rsvndump's behavior and possible
        differences to the output generated by <i>svnadmin dump</i>
        and <i>svnrdump</i> can be found at the <a href="manpage.html">man page</a>.</p>

          <p>rsvndump 0.6 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
          offering new features and fixing several bugs. The version
          path and property storages have been redesigned, resulting
          in a notable speedup. An issue that could have led to unloadable
          dumps hen dumping subdirectories has been resolved.
          Furthermore, revision range handling in incremental mode and a build system issue
          (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3515292&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#3515292</a>)
          have been fixed.<br/>

          The full list of changes can be found in the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
          is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as

          <li><h4>March 11th, 2012</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.8 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
          fixing two serious bugs reported by Valentin Haenel

          Both issues could result in invalid dump output
          under certain circumstances.  Please consult the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> and the respective bug reports
          for further details about those issues.<br/>

          <li><h4>November 21st, 2011</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.7 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
          fixing possibly invalid dump output when run with
          <tt>--keep-revnums</tt>.  Furthermore, the command-line flags
          <tt>--dry-run</tt> and <tt>--obfuscate</tt> have been added
          to ease the submission of dumps for bug reports. A build
          system fix from Sebastian Pipping has been applied as well
          (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3369622&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#3369622</a>).

          <p>rsvndump 0.5.6 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
          release includes performance improvements for revision range
          determination and path hash calculations. A bug that could cause
          unloadable dumps under certain conditions as well as a possible
          segmentation fault have been fixed. The CodeBlocks project file
          for Compilation on Windows has been fixed, too.

          <li><h4>March 3rd, 2011</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.5 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
          release fixes a bug introduced in 0.5.3 
          (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2997558&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2997558</a>)
          which could led to crashes when dumping a
          subdirectory. Additionally, performance issues caused by
          unnecessary stats for copied revisions have been fixed. The
          full list of changes can be found in the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
          is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as

          <li><h4>February 13th, 2011</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.4 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
          release mainly fixes dumping with text deltas. In previous versions,
          the delta didn't work and the full file content would be dumped in
          svndiff format. Please note that these dumps could be imported just
          fine and resulted in correct repositories.
          Additionally, support for the <tt>--config-dir</tt> option of the
          normal <i>svn</i> command-line client has been added, and a couple
          of minor issues have been fixed. The build instructions for Windows
          have been updated, too.
