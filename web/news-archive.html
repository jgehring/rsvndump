        <li><h4>March 3rd, 2011</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.5.5 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
        release fixes a bug introduced in 0.5.3
        (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2997558&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2997558</a>)
        which could led to crashes when dumping a
        subdirectory. Additionally, performance issues caused by
        unnecessary stats for copied revisions have been fixed. The
        full list of changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
        is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
        well as in zip format.<br /></p></li>

        <li><h4>February 13th, 2011</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.5.4 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
        release mainly fixes dumping with text deltas. In previous versions,
        the delta didn't work and the full file content would be dumped in
        svndiff format. Please note that these dumps could be imported just
        fine and resulted in correct repositories.
        Additionally, support for the <tt>--config-dir</tt> option of the
        normal <i>svn</i> command-line client has been added, and a couple
        of minor issues have been fixed. The build instructions for Windows
        have been updated, too.
        The full list of changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is

        <li><h4>December 15th, 2009</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.5.3 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
        release fixes a couple of serious bugs reported via the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=1143180&group_id=268687">bug tracker</a>
        at SourceForge, including a bug that could prevent directory
        properties from being dumped
        (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2898815&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2898815</a>).
        Additionally, detection for paths affected by directory copy
        operations has been added. This fixes the generation of unloadable
        dumps observed in specific cases (as reported in
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2898487&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2898487</a>
        by lordnightwalker). Dumping root node modifications has been fixed,
        too.
        The full list of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. The source package is
        is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
        well as in zip format.<br />
        Please note that the Debian packages haven't been updated (and are
        unlikely to be updated again). Please refer to the
        source tarball instead.
        </p></li>

        <li><h4>July 17th, 2009</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.5.2 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
        fixing wrong Node-copyfrom-rev revision numbers when dumping subdirectories,
        as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2820774&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">reported in #2820774 by poeml</a>.
        Furthermore, a possible segmentation fault when dumping in incremental mode
        and starting at revision 1 has been fixed.
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
        is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
        well as in zip format. The Debian packages have been updated, too.<br />
        I should also note that for practical reason, the <i>downloads archive</i>
        has been replaced by a simple link to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rsvndump/files/">files available at SourceForge</a>,
        as I've uploaded all previous releases via the file release system.
        </p></li>

        <li><h4>July 11th, 2009</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.5.1 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
        fixing a bug that caused properties to get dropped silently and some
        memory leaks. Additionally, rsvndump will now build successfully using
        the MSVC compiler on Windows. A corresponding CodeBlocks project file
        is included in the source distribution, which is now available in zip
        format, too.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
        is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.
        The Debian packages have been updated, too.<br />
        On a side note, the web page and its "About" section have been
        updated and are now hosted on <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</a>.
        All previous releases of rsvndump are now available at the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rsvndump/files/">downloads archive</a>.</p></li>

        <li><h4>June 1st, 2009</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.5 is now <a href="#content">available</a>.
        This is again a complete rewrite of the program and introduces
        new features as well as bugfixes. The most important features
        are the ability to perform incremental dumps and the support
        for dumping text deltas instead of the usual fulltext. The
        authentication system has been been improved, too. The bugfixes
        include a fix for missing file contents if a file has been copied
        and changed in the same revision file, which could occur under
        certain circumstances.<br />
        Some of the command line switches of the 0.4-series have become
        obsolete now. You will get a warning message if you use them,
        so you should probably do a manual run if you invoke rsvndump
        via a different program, e.g. as a cronjob.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
        is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.
        The Debian packages have been updated, too.<br />
        I have also uploaded my local repository to
        <a href="http://github.com/jgehring/rsvndump">github.org</a>,
        so please feel free to clone it.</p></li>

        <li><h4>April 15th, 2009</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.4-1 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
        fixing build issues with Subversion 1.6.1. Please note that you
        will see warnings about deprecated functions when compiling
        the package, but it should build without errors.<br />
        As usual, the source package is available as a tarball compressed
        using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated,
        too.</p></li>

        <li><h4>March 30th, 2009</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.4 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
        release adds a command line option to disable the need for manually
        accepting a SSL certificate (<i>--no-check-certificate</i>), which
        is useful when calling rsvndump from within a script. Additionally,
        the program has been made translatable using
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU gettext</a>.
        A German translation of all output strings is already included.<br />
        As usual, the source package is available as a tarball compressed
        using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated,
        too.</p></li>

        <li><h4>November 21th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.3 is now <a href="#content">available</a>.
        This release includes new features as well as bugfixes: the
        command line option <i>--dump-uuid</i> has been added, which
        dumps the uuid of a repository and is useful if repositories
        should be cloned. A bug which could occur when dumping a
        sub-directory via a file://-url has been fixed. As a minor change,
        the svn dump format produces has been changed to version "2"
        because <i>svndumpfilter</i> refuses to read dump files with
        format "3" in current versions (currently, this does not affect
        the rsvndump's output except for a number at the start).<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
        available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.
        The Debian packages have been updated, too.</p></li>

        <li><h4>October 27th, 2008</h4>
        <p>I updated the ABOUT-section on this web page, and there's
        now a <a href="news-archive.html">seperate page</a> which serves
        as a news archive. Only the 5 latest news items will be displayed
        on the main page now.</p></li>

        <li><h4>October 8th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.2 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This is a bugfix
        release, fixing a segmentation fault that could occur when using the new
        <i>--keep-revnums</i> flag.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is available

        have been updated, too.</p></li>

        <li><h4>October 5th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.1 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This release includes new features, mainly a command line option to keep
        revision numbers in sync with the source repository by adding empty
        revisions for padding. This is useful when dumping a sub-path without
        changing revision numbers. Adidtionally, a bug preventing a single file to
        be dumped in offline mode when using the <i>--quiet</i> flag has been
        fixed.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is available
        as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages
        have been updated, too.</p></li>

        <li><h4>October 1st, 2008</h4>

        <a href="index.html#content">Debian package</a> for x86 and ARM processors.
        Both packages have been generated on Debian Etch and should also work on
        Ubuntu.</p></li>

        <li><h4>September 29th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This release includes new features as well as bugfixes and is actually
        a complete rewrite of the program. The major changes include automatic log
        history fetching, heavy speed improvements for both online and offline mode
        and a more convenient ./configure script with proper checks for the Apache
        Runtime libraries.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is available
        as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.</p>
        <p>Additionally, rsvndump is now released under the GNU General Public
        License, Version 3, which was needed because some autoconf macros which
        are used by rsvndump have been licensed under the Apache License, Version
        2.0. This license is incompatible to the GPLv2, so I upgraded to the
        compatible GPLv3.</p></li>

        <li><h4>September 8th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.3.2 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.

        memory pools. Additionally, changes were made to the node dumping order.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is available
        as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.</li>

        <li><h4>September 3rd, 2008</h4>
        <p>I updated the README to reflect the dependencies of rsvndump
        (Subversion and Apache Portable Runtime).</p></li>

        <li><h4>September 1st, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.3.1 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This is mainly a bugfix release, fixing two issues regarding copy resolving
        and a memory leak. As an additional feature, the dumped data can be prefixed
        with a custom string now.<br />
