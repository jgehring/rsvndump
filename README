rsvndump 0.6.2
Copyright (C) 2008-present by Jonas Gehring


ABOUT
=====
rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a subversion repository
that resides on a remote server. All data is dumped in the format that can be
read/written by svnadmin, so the data produced by rsvndump can easily be
imported into a new subversion repository.


REQUIREMENTS
============
rsvndump depends on Subversion (>= 1.4), which depends on the Apache Portable
Runtime. Therefore, to build rsvndump from source, the development and
runtime files (headers and libraries) of both libraries must be present on the
system.


USAGE
=====
Basic usage information can be retrieved by passing the '--help' argument to
the program.
More detailed information is included in the man page. To generate and install
it, pass '--enable-man' to the configure script. Please note that this requires
recent versions of asciidoc ( http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ ) and xmlto
( https://fedorahosted.org/xmlto/ ).
An HTML-version of the man page can be found online at
http://rsvndump.sourceforge.net/manpage.html
