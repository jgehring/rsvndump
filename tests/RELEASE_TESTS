Tests that should be run prior to a release
===========================================

> Test database:
  - ./tdb.py all
  - ./tdb.py all --verbose
  - ./tdb.py all --deltas
  - ./tdb.py all --deltas --keep-revnums
  - ./tdb.py all --keep-revnums

> Other tests:
  - configure with --enable-tests and run 'make test'
  - ./incremental.pl $REPO and ./incremental.pl $REPO/subdir
    > compare .dumps/{normal,incremental}
    > compare svnadmin dumps of repositories constructed using
      .dumps/{normal,incremental}
    Please not that it's normal that files in the incremental dump
    may be dumped with their contents even if they are full copies.
    The incremental dump simply doesn't have information about checksums
    of files in previous revisions.
